import time

# Define PID gain values as global variables to prevent them from resetting to zero each time function is called
#Needs PID gain values for pitch roll and yaw indivudally which are the rotations of the vehicle along the x,y,z axis respectivley
#Consider if it is possible to only utlisze pitch and roll since yaw seems redundant as it is the z axis movement
Example 
kprop_pitch = 
kint_pitch =
kder_pitch = 
kprop_roll = 
kint_roll =
kder_roll = 
etc.

#Other variables below
setpoint = 0
