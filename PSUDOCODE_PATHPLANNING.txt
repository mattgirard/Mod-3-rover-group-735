#This is the psudo code

Matt's code:

Target= (x., y.)
Rover= (x, y)

Heading to Target (htt)= tan^-1([x-x.]/[y-y.])
Distance to target (dtt)= Sqrt([x-x.]^2 + [y-y.]^2)

Lidar data: #not sure how sensors are labeled, but assuming that they are numbered in order
#going to use the notation of lidar[1], lidar[2], lidar[3], etc for sensors. lidar[1] being most left sensor and lidar[32] being furthest right sensor

if rover.heading != htt:
    Turn rover such that rover.heading = htt #assuming that this means lidar[16] will be in direction of htt

if ||ldt|| < ddt:
    for x in range(lidar sensors/2):
    if distance.lidar[16-1]>=ddt:
        move in direction of lidar[16-1]
    
    if distance.lidar[16+1]>=ddt:
        move in direction of lidar[16+1]
